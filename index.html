                            <p>Alcohol policies on party buses vary by state and city. In many U.S. states, passengers may drink on a chartered party bus as long as the vehicle has proper licensing. However, rules differ significantly — some cities require a special permit, while others prohibit open containers entirely. PartyBusTravel provides <strong>city-specific alcohol rules</strong> for every hub so you always know what's allowed before you book.</p>

                            <p>Party buses come in various sizes: <strong>Small (12–20 passengers)</strong>, <strong>Mid-size (20–30 passengers)</strong>, and <strong>Large (30–50+ passengers)</strong>. Choosing the right size is important for comfort and safety. Our group-size selector helps you find the perfect vehicle — we enforce strict max capacity rules so you never end up on an overcrowded bus.</p>

                            <p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> A party bus for concerts and festivals eliminates parking stress, keeps your group together through chaotic venues, provides a pre-game space with music and drinks, and guarantees a safe late-night ride home. When you split the cost among 15–30 people, it's often cheaper than individual parking plus rideshares — and infinitely more fun.</p>

                            <p>Book <strong>3–6 weeks in advance</strong> for standard events. For peak times like prom season (April–June), New Year's Eve, major holidays, or big local events, book <strong>6–8 weeks or more</strong>. Last-minute bookings are sometimes available but you'll have fewer options and may pay premium rates. Pro tip: weekday bookings often have better availability and lower prices.</p>

                            <p><strong>In most cases, yes.</strong> A 4-hour party bus rental averages $800–$1,200, which split among 15 people is $53–$80 per person for the entire night. Compare that to 4–5 rideshares each way at surge pricing after an event — easily $30–$50 per person per trip. The party bus is one flat cost for unlimited stops, plus you get the experience of traveling together. No surge pricing, no "where are you?" texts.</p>
